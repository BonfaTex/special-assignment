 ## ‚úàÔ∏è Estimating Aircraft Orientation with EKF

 In recent years, Bayesian filtering and smoothing have become a hot research topic due to its range of application. Time-varying systems can be found, for example, in navigation, aerospace engineering, remote surveillance and telecommunications. Often, the underlying phenomena are non-linear, requiring more attention in the computations. One filter that handles non-linear models by linearizing them is the **Extended Kalman Filter** (EKF). It combines the prediction of the state with noisy measurements to update the solution üöÄ 
 
 In this work, we present the EKF algorithm for estimating aircraft orientation using gyroscope and accelerometer measurements.
